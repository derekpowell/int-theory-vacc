Not every scientist is a Saint, and some succumb to financial pressures or tempations. It only takes a few to ruin a business's reputation.  Body chemistry is amazing, and of course what helps 95% of kids may not help you kid or not as much as expected. And that's where intuition (or just ""hands on"" experience matters. Of course the best Doctors form a partnership and dig for that information.  Sadly, many are so time pressured that they don't do that as much as they should.","02bb41585475d9eb","3R5F3LQFV2K3WY8F0I3127AODQZZOE","382GHPVPHSRVLSTA6POHWO4IA2I346","12","1.6"
